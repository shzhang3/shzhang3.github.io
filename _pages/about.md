I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington, working with <a href='https://jingweihu-math.github.io/webpage/'>Prof. Jingwei Hu</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Purdue University under the supervision of <a href='https://www.math.purdue.edu/~shen7/'>Prof. Jie Shen</a> and my B.S. in Mathematics from Southern University of Science and Technology under the supervision of <a href='https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=yangj7&orderby=date&iscss=1&snapid=1&go=2&lang=en'>Prof. Jiang Yang</a> and <a href='http://maths.nju.edu.cn/~hebma/'>Prof. Bingsheng He</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization, deep learning, dynamical low-rank approximation, and scientific computing.
